## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report a vulnerability via GitHub's [Secutiry Advisories](https://github.com/dsogari/doml/security/advisories).

You can expect to get an update on the report within one week. If the vulnerability is confirmed, we commit to either fixing it ourselves or accepting a high-priority pull request. Otherwise, you will receive a justification for its dismissal.
